**Technical Decisions
State Management:
Used React Context API for lightweight authentication and role-based access.

**Data Handling:
All data (users, patients, incidents) is persisted via localStorage. File uploads are stored as base64 strings.

**Styling:
TailwindCSS used for consistent design and rapid development.

Routing:
Protected routes implemented using a custom ProtectedRoute wrapper with role restrictions.

**Responsiveness:
Fully responsive layout tested on desktop and mobile.

**Known Issues
Data is device-bound. Since localStorage is used, data wonâ€™t sync across devices unless manually seeded.
No actual backend: user registration or reset password is simulated only.
File uploads are stored in base64 and may increase localStorage size for larger files.
